#### Mac Requirements

* Mac OS X 10.7 +
* [Documentation](https://github.com/penguinho/appium/blob/mac-driver/docs/en/appium-setup/running-on-osx.md#testing-mac-apps)

Currently, the Mac app driver for appium does not ship with the AppiumForMac binary, which means, in order to automate Mac apps you must manually install the AppiumForMac application and grant it the appropriate OS X Accessibility permissions.

To Install Appium for Mac:
1. [Download a release](https://github.com/appium/appium-for-mac/releases/tag/0.2.0) and unzip the application into your `/Applications` folder
2. Follow the [brief supplemental installation instructions](https://github.com/appium/appium-for-mac#installation) to enable appium to have access to OS X's Accessibility APIs

For more information on using Appium for mac, checkout the [docs](https://github.com/appium/appium-for-mac#appium-for-mac).
